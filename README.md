2. **Identify Trends**:
   - Uncover trends in loan approval rates, default rates, and repayment performance over time.

3. **Analyze Borrower Demographics**:
   - Analyze borrower demographics such as age, income level, and credit score to identify patterns and risk factors.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Provide key performance metrics such as average loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment durations.

5. **Interactive Filtering**:
   - Allow users to filter data based on various criteria to drill down into specific segments and obtain tailored insights.
     

**-- The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision by using clear, actionable insights from loan data.**
